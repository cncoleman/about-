This means that cool and interactive visualizations generated using Python or R can be rendered directly in the page. Please ensure that the essential library dependencies are installed to render the visualizations. For example, the following visualization requires plotly library which is installed along with the requirements. Whenever you install a new library, don’t forget to add it to requirements.txt.\n  Whenever an interactive visualization is added, an equivalent static image alternative should also be added for the Anthology print version. Refer to the code below.\n  The content below will appear only in the html version.\n  \n  Interactive Plotly Chart\n  For a demonstration of a Plotly chart, see Figure 1.\n  \n  \n  \n\n                                                  \n  Figure 1: Example Interactive Plotly Chart\n  \n  \n  \n  The content below will appear only in the pdf output but not in the html version."
