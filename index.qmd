project-description: "This is project undertaken by the 2023-2024 Fellows cohort to explore data available as digital traces of CESTA. The sources are the events listing on the CESTA website, earlier events scraped from the Internet Archive's web archive of CESTA's online presence, and CESTA's newsletter archive from the Mailchimp application."

# CESTA's Web Presence

This article focuses on the authoring capablities of Quarto. This article is written using [Quarto's Markdown](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html). All the quarto markdown tags are supported for authoring the article. Please refer to the Quarto's official documentation for the available markdown options. Quarto allows a variety of features such using figures, tables, diagrams, videos, embeds, code annotations and more. It allows the authors to run Python scripts and embed the output in the article.

### Callouts

Quarto allows different types of callouts to emphasize the content.

::: {.callout-note}
Note that there are five types of callouts, including:
`note`, `warning`, `important`, `tip`, and `caution`.
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
## Tip with Title
This is an example of a callout with a title.
:::

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## Expand To Learn About Collapse
This is an example of a 'folded' caution callout that can be expanded by the user. You can use `collapse="true"` to collapse it by default or `collapse="false"` to make a collapsible callout that is expanded by default.
:::


### Figures
In Quarto, figures can be easily imported using the markdown syntax, given the image is stored in the codebase. You can see the example given below.

![This is an example image](data/imgs/placeholder.jpg)

Below is a full column image.

### Tables
In Quarto, tables can be easily created using the pipe table markdown syntax. You can see the example given below.

| Default | Left | Right | Center |
|---------|:-----|------:|:------:|
| 12      | 12   |    12 |   12   |
| 123     | 123  |   123 |  123   |
| 1       | 1    |     1 |   1    |

### Diagrams
Quarto allows natively the authors to create diagrams using Mermaid and Graphviz. Check the [official documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/diagrams.html) for more details.

Below is an example of a Mermaid diagram.
```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  A[Hard edge] --> B(Round edge)
  B --> C{Decision}
  C --> D[Result one]
  C --> E[Result two]
```

### Videos
In Quarto, videos can be embedded from both locally and remote sources such as YouTube and Vimeo.
{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/wo9vZccmqwc >}}

### Appendices and Footnotes
Quarto allows the authors to create appendices and footnotes easily.

#### Appendix
In Quarto, appendices can be created using the `.appendix` class. The appendix section is placed at the end of the document and is not included in the table of contents.

##### Appendix Example {.appendix}
Here is an example of an appendix.

#### Footnote
Here is a footnote reference,[^1] and another.[^longnote]

[^1]: Here is the footnote.

[^longnote]: Here's one with multiple blocks.

    Subsequent paragraphs are indented to show that they
belong to the previous footnote.

    The whole paragraph can be indented, or just the first
    line.  In this way, multi-paragraph footnotes work like
    multi-paragraph list items.




# Title of Article 2
:::{.article-author}
Flora Yuan
:::

This article focuses on the computational capabilities of Quarto.  


## Visualizations
Quarto allows the users to run Python and R code directly in the page and get their output. This means that cool and interactive visualizations generated using Python or R can be rendered directly in the page. Please ensure that the essential library dependencies are installed to render the visualizations. For example, the following visualization requires `plotly` library which is installed along with the requirements. Whenever you install a new library, don't forget to add it to `requirements.txt`.

Whenever an interactive visualization is added, an equivalent static image alternative should also be added for the Anthology print version. Refer to the code below.

The content below will appear only in the html version.

::: {.content-visible when-format="html"}
### Interactive Plotly Chart
For a demonstration of a Plotly chart, see @fig-example.

```{python}
#| label: fig-example
#| fig-cap: Example Interactive Plotly Chart
import plotly.express as px
df = px.data.iris()
fig = px.scatter(df, x="sepal_width", y="sepal_length", color="species",
                 size='petal_length', hover_data=['petal_width'])
fig.show()
```
:::

The content below will appear only in the pdf output but not in the html version.

::: {.content-visible when-format="pdf"}
The below content will appear only in PDF format.

## Observable
Similar to Python and R code, Quarto is also capable of handling Observable. Please refer to the [official documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/ojs.html) for more details.
